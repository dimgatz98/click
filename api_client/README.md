# API client

If the virtual environment is created correctly on the top-level directory of the project as shown [here](https://github.com/dimgatz98/click/blob/master/README.md) then you will be able to run the api client as shown below:
``` bash
./apiclient --help
```
else you will have either have to modify the shebang or use the python3 keyword (e.g. "python3 apiclient --help").
